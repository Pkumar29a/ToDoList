# ToDoList
Coding-Ninja-Frontend test: Todolist

Introduction
This project is a straightforward implementation of a todo list application using front-end technologies. It provides a user-friendly interface to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them from the list.


The code consists of three main files:

index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the todo list application, including the input field, task list, and associated elements. It references the CSS and JavaScript files.

styles.css: The CSS file defines the styles and layout of the application, including fonts, background color, and alignment.

script.js: The JavaScript file provides the functionality to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. It also updates the task count.
